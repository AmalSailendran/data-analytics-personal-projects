# Netflix Userbase Dataset Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a sample Netflix userbase dataset, which provides insights into user subscriptions, revenue, account details, and activity. The dataset represents a synthetic representation of Netflix user data and includes information such as subscription type, monthly revenue, join date, last payment date, country, device type, total watch time, and account status.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset provides a snapshot of a sample Netflix userbase and includes the following columns:

- User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
- Subscription Type: The type of subscription (Basic, Standard, or Premium) for each user.
- Monthly Revenue: The monthly revenue generated from each user's subscription.
- Join Date: The date when the user joined Netflix.
- Last Payment Date: The date of the user's last payment.
- Country: The country in which the user is located.
- Device: The type of device used by the user (e.g., Smart TV, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet).
- Plan Duration: The duration of the associated plan

Please note that this dataset is a synthetic representation and does not reflect actual Netflix user data.

## Questions Answered

The analysis of the Netflix userbase dataset aims to answer the following questions:

1. What is the distribution of subscription types (Basic, Standard, Premium) among the Netflix userbase?
2. How does the monthly revenue generated from subscriptions vary across different subscription types?
3. What is the average duration between a user joining Netflix and making their last payment?
4. Are there any correlations between the user's device type and their subscription type?
